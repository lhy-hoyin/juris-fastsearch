# Juris FastSearch

Juris FastSearch is a legal case retrieval solution for the legal community to quickly and efficiently seach and retrieve relevant law cases and citations for their current case.

#### Problem

Currently, it is tedious for law professionals to prepare for their cases as they have to manually look for precedence or similar cases as part of their legal research. With advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), ChatGPT maybe a tempting solution to quickly resovle that. However, AI solutions are prone to "hallucinations", making up fake cases which may appear to support the user's case, as it has already [happened before](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/06/08/lawyer-used-chatgpt-in-court-and-cited-fake-cases-a-judge-is-considering-sanctions/).

Juris FastSearch is able to quickly provide references without any risk of "hallucinations". Explore our [design](docs/Design.md) to see how we ensure relevant cases without any possibility of bogus cases, as well as optimizations done to ensure a fast search.
